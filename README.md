## TOMATO – Food Ordering Website

This project presents TOMATO, a dynamic food ordering platform designed to provide a seamless online ordering experience. The primary objective of this system is to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the implementation of key design patterns within a real-world application.

## Project Structure

- `/admin` — admin panel source code.
- `/frontend` — customer-facing frontend source code.
- `/backend` — backend REST API source code.
- `/src` — project architecture and future TypeScript migration planning.
- `/docs` — design documentation and architecture notes.
- `/diagrams` — ER diagram and modeling artifacts.
- `/db` — database scripts or migration helpers.

## Design Patterns

- **MVC Pattern**: The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns. Models (e.g., `backend/models/userModel.ts`) handle data and business logic, Controllers (e.g., `backend/controllers/userController.ts`) manage application logic and user input, and Views (e.g., `frontend/src/components/`) handle the presentation layer. This promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability, aligning with SDLC best practices for scalable development.

## Design Progress

- Base classes and interfaces have been started in `docs/design.md`.
- One design pattern is documented in `docs/design.md`.
- Entity relationship and cardinality information is available in `diagrams/er-diagram.md`.
- SDLC and OOP concepts are summarized in `docs/design.md`.
